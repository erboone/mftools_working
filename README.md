### mftools

This is the new repo for the epigenome center's spatial data processing software. Please feel free to raise an issue including any useful functions/scripts/etc that you have written, and we will implement them to be reused and shared. Thank you!

# Eric's note 2024.10.25

This package is a total mess. The path forward is clear so a lot of this is going to get cleaned up, especially the scripts and similar. The majority of work is being done in mfexperiment and fileio in the mftools/ directory. Good luck.
